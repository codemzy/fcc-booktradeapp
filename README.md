    FCC Book Trading App
    CODEMZY


User stories:

1. I can view all books posted by every user.
2. I can add a new book.
3. I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
4. I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

Note: As this is an example project app, I haven't fully implemented the trade credits. Credits are earned by trading books, if this was a production app, credits would also be required for requesting books.
